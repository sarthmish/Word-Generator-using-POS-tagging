# Word-Generator-using-POS-tagging
Project Overview
This project aims to generate words based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. By analyzing the POS tags of given input text, the system generates new words that fit the syntactic structure of the input. This can be useful in various natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as text generation, language modeling, and creative writing tools.
